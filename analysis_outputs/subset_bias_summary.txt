Top 20 Improvements for subset_bias

Example 1:
Premise: A man in a blue shirt, khaki shorts, ball cap and white socks and loafers walking behind a group of people walking down a stone walkway with a water bottle in his left hand.
Hypothesis: A man in a blue shirt, khaki shorts, ball cap and blue socks and loafers walking behind a group of people walking down a stone walkway with a water bottle in his left hand.
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.917)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.967)
Why Baseline Failed: High lexical overlap (1.00) likely influenced prediction; Hypothesis words being subset of premise may have caused bias
Why Debiased Succeeded: Model correctly focused on semantic meaning despite high overlap
