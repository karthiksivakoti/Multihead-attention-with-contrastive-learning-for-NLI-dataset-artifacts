Top 20 Improvements for overlap_bias

Example 1:
Premise: A group of teenagers are standing in front of some tents, most of them are holding skateboards.
Hypothesis: A group of teenagers are jumping
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.452)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.953)
Why Baseline Failed: Length difference of 11 words may have biased the model; High lexical overlap (0.83) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Debiased model successfully ignored length difference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 2:
Premise: Three people are outside walking up a set of wooden stairs.
Hypothesis: Three people are walking outside down a set of stairs.
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.500)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.995)
Why Baseline Failed: High lexical overlap (0.90) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Model correctly focused on semantic meaning despite high overlap

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 3:
Premise: A young blond child wearing only a diaper sits on a large rock at the edge of a body of water while a large black dog stands in the water nearby.
Hypothesis: A dog sits on a rock alone.
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.424)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.830)
Why Baseline Failed: Length difference of 24 words may have biased the model; High lexical overlap (0.83) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Debiased model successfully ignored length difference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 4:
Premise: Two women are posing with the Naked Cowboy in Times Square, New York City.
Hypothesis: Two women are touring New York City.
Gold Label: 1
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.610)
Debiased: 1 (conf: 0.950)
Why Baseline Failed: Length difference of 7 words may have biased the model; High lexical overlap (0.86) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Debiased model successfully ignored length difference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 5:
Premise: Three individuals are wearing tight blue nylon suits with one instructor in all black with a ponytail assisting them with putting on harnesses.
Hypothesis: Three individuals are wearing tight blue nylon suits outside.
Gold Label: 1
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.547)
Debiased: 1 (conf: 0.784)
Why Baseline Failed: Length difference of 14 words may have biased the model; High lexical overlap (0.89) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Debiased model successfully ignored length difference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 6:
Premise: A man in a denim shirt and pants is smoking a cigarette while playing a cello for money.
Hypothesis: A man in denim shirt is smoking marbellos.
Gold Label: 1
Baseline: 2 (conf: 0.467)
Debiased: 1 (conf: 0.631)
Why Baseline Failed: Length difference of 10 words may have biased the model; High lexical overlap (0.88) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Debiased model successfully ignored length difference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 7:
Premise: A man in a blue shirt, khaki shorts, ball cap and white socks and loafers walking behind a group of people walking down a stone walkway with a water bottle in his left hand.
Hypothesis: A man in a blue shirt, khaki shorts, ball cap and blue socks and loafers walking behind a group of people walking down a stone walkway with a water bottle in his left hand.
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.917)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.967)
Why Baseline Failed: High lexical overlap (1.00) likely influenced prediction; Hypothesis words being subset of premise may have caused bias
Why Debiased Succeeded: Model correctly focused on semantic meaning despite high overlap

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 8:
Premise: A brown dog with a blue muzzle is running on green grass.
Hypothesis: A dog is wearing a green muzzle on blue grass.
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 0 (conf: 0.950)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.986)
Why Baseline Failed: High lexical overlap (0.89) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Model correctly focused on semantic meaning despite high overlap

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 9:
Premise: Three sisters, barefoot in pink dresses and who range in age from preschool to teenager are pictured on a beach as they look out at the Ocean.
Hypothesis: Three sisters, barefoot in pink dresses and who range in age from preschool to 90
Gold Label: 2
Baseline: 1 (conf: 0.939)
Debiased: 2 (conf: 0.616)
Why Baseline Failed: Length difference of 12 words may have biased the model; High lexical overlap (0.93) likely influenced prediction
Why Debiased Succeeded: Debiased model successfully ignored length difference
