## Overview üìä

This repository implements a novel multi-head debiasing architecture for Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, focusing on reducing dataset artifacts while maintaining high performance. Our approach combines:
- Contrastive learning
- Explicit bias prediction
- Temperature-scaled outputs
- Multi-artifact attention mechanism

## Key Features ‚≠ê

- **Multi-Head Architecture**: Simultaneously addresses multiple types of artifacts
- **Artifact-Aware Attention**: Dynamically weighs different artifacts during inference
- **Advanced Loss Integration**: Combines task-specific and debiasing objectives
- **Comprehensive Analysis Framework**: Tools for quantifying and visualizing bias patterns
